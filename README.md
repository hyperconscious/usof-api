# USOF API

## Overview

The **USOF API** is a backend system designed to support user-generated content, with endpoints for managing posts, comments, categories, and user authentication. This API enables post creation with attachments, user comments, likes/dislikes, and includes JWT-based authentication. It utilizes **MySQL** for persistent storage, **Multer** for handling file uploads, and **Node.js** with **TypeScript** for scalable and maintainable code.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Supports JWT authentication with access, refresh, and email verification tokens.
- **CRUD Operations**: Endpoints for managing posts, comments, and categories.
- **File Uploads**: Uploads images for posts and user avatars.

## Database Schema


The database follows a relational structure using MySQL with the following key tables:
- **User**: Stores user information and authentication data.
- **Post**: Contains posts created by users.
- **Comment**: Linked to posts for user comments.
- **Category**: Supports categorization of posts.
- **Likes**: Tracks likes/dislikes on posts and comments.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the following:

- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set.
- Verify that the MySQL database is running and accessible.
- Make sure secrets are set and tokens havenâ€™t expired.
- Check the server logs for any error messages.
- Consult the project documentation and FAQs.
